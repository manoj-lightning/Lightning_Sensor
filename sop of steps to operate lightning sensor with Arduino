step-1  Download the Arduino IDE from the terminal
        open the terminal 
        enter_sudo_apt_update
        sudo apt install arduino

step-2  Download the sensor library (.cpp and .h file ) from the web git hub 
        open the search option and enter git hub lightning sensor (aS3935)
        open the git hub and download the .cpp and .h 
        add these library to a new file and then give a name to that file as lightning sensor

step-3  connect the module (sensor) to the arduino according to the connection diagram
        connections are ;  
                      IrQ-2 digital pin 
                      D - A4
                      c-  A5
                      _ -GND
                      + - 5v

step-4 copy the sensor code from the web page of Df robot  gravity lightning sensor AS3935
       paste the code in the new file of the arduino Ide 

step-5 modyfy the I2c address before running the code

step-6 open the arduino ide uplode the sample code to the arduino uno 

step-7 befor running the code check the usb connection, serial port, programming then run the sample code

step-8  open the tools
        click on the serial monitor 
        set the baud rate to t5he 115200
